"After Delhi, Maharashtra Govt Too Advocates EV Adoption; To Incentivise Usage By Aggregators ",https://inc42.com/buzz/after-delhi-maharashtra-govt-too-advocates-ev-adoption-to-incentivise-usage-by-aggregators/,"The automobile industry is one of the key sectors driving India’s economic growth, especially now that the aggregator economy is booming Simultaneously, many state governments have been keen on adopting a cleaner automotive approach by shifting to electric vehicles (EV)




To achieve its target of cleaner air by 2025, the Maharashtra State Government will offer companies like Amazon and Uber new incentives to electrify their delivery fleets, a Reuters report said Last year, the Maharashtra government had set a target for such companies to electrify 25% of their fleet by 2025

The state minister for tourism Aditya Thackeray stated that the government is looking to make the shift before 2025 “This not only benefits us in terms of cleaner air but also benefits them [EV adopters] in terms of economies and their revenue models,” he said
The state is likely to approach Amazon, Uber, Flipkart, Ola, Zomato and Swiggy, among others next month


The push comes weeks after Delhi, issued strict draft rules for companies to get a licence on the condition that a certain percentage of their new fleet is electric
The Delhi State Government has also suggested a similar move before, asking cab aggregators, food delivery startups and other ecommerce companies to switch to EVs The move is intended as part of its policy to ensure that 25% of all vehicles sold in the region are electric vehicles by 2024
The Delhi government has also approved a single-window facility to arrange the installation of EV charging infrastructure at private and public places such as apartments, group housing societies, hospitals, malls and movie halls in Delhi NCR
Only yesterday (February 9, 2022), the Delhi government notified that all its office buildings will have EV charging stations This comes on the back of the Delhi govt incentivising charging infrastructure by granting INR 6,000 in subsidy for the first 30,000 private charging points in the city
In July 2021, the Karnataka government announced a new policy to allow electric bike taxis to run on the road for a limited distance Additionally, in the scheme permission to operate bike taxis has been allowed to only EVs and not those running on petrol and diesel



Not just state governments, but the central government is making partial modifications in the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India Phase II (FAME India Phase II) incentives for electric two-wheeler makers
The government has increased the incentive or uniform subsidy for electric two-wheelers to INR 15,000 per kWh from INR 10,000 per KWh for all EVs made in India
The Shift To EV Among Aggregators
In February 2021, Flipkart announced that it is looking to deploy 25K EVs to its delivery fleet by 2030 The Walmart-owned company will also create charging infrastructure at its delivery hubs and offices across the country The company has already started off the project by deploying 450 two and three-wheelers in several cities, in partnership with Hero Electric, Mahindra Electric, and Piaggio to make customised vehicles
Its rival Amazon India set a target of having 10K EVs by 2025 and partnered with automobile manufacturer Mahindra Electric to further strengthen its commitment towards e-mobility in the country
In 2021, Uber India was looking to add around 3K electric vehicles and e-rickshaws to its fleet by the end of 2021 While the updated number is unknown, Uber has partnered with Startup India to fund Indian startups in the EVs ecosystem
Food aggregator Swiggy has also partnered with TVS Motor Company to add more electric two-wheelers to its delivery fleet with an aim to have its drivers make at least 800,000 kilometres per day through EVs by 2025, the company claims



Zomato’s founder and chief executive Deepinder Goyal, in a blog post published in June 2021, had also claimed that EV will be essential in the long run The company is currently delivering through EVs in Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai, and plans to electrify 100% of its fleet by 2030"

Crypto Is A Threat To India’s Macroeconomic Stability: RBI Governor Sh... ,https://inc42.com/buzz/crypto-is-a-threat-to-indias-macroeconomic-stability-rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das/,"While the Budget announcements for cryptocurrencies have generally shown a positive reaction throughout the industry, RBI’s post monetary policy comment on crypto has been quite the knee-jerker
The RBI governor has cautioned investors on the risks posed by private cryptocurrencies in India He said, “Private cryptocurrencies are a threat to macroeconomic and financial stability and investors, who are investing at their own risk, should keep risks in mind”

He added that crypto as assets have no underlying value whatsoever, “not even a tulip”
For those wondering the ‘tulip’ metaphor meaning, Tulip mania was a period in the 17th century when tulips were JUST introduced People bought them in large quantities causing their prices to shoot up


The undermining of cryptocurrencies by the RBI governor is followed by Finance Secretary TV Somanathan’s comment that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum will never be legal tenders in India — ie a form of money that is legally accepted as a form of payment
He had stated, “Digital currency will be backed by RBI which will never be a default Money will be from the RBI, but nature will be digital Digital rupee issued by RBI will be a legal tender Rest all (Bitcoin and the like) aren’t legal tender, and will never become legal tender”
“People investing in private crypto should understand that it does not have the authorisation of the government There is no guarantee whether your investment will be successful or not, one may suffer losses and govt is not responsible for this,” Somanathan added




The comments from two high-profile government officials about crypto come within a fortnight of the Budget announcement Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had proposed a 30% tax on income from digital assets including income from crypto and NFTs
According to many crypto experts and enthusiasts, 30% tax is levied on gambling, and the industry is not happy with comparing the likeness of crypto trading to gambling
Despite the unhappiness, one thing among crypto investors, and other stakeholders was clear — India was warming up to the adoption of cryptocurrency According to reports, there are 1007 Cr crypto investors in India, and about 2 Cr joined the crypto bandwagon in 2021 alone
The government had also proposed to launch its much anticipated sovereign-backed central bank digital currency (CBDC) or ‘digital rupee’ in 2022-2023
But the comments from senior officials working with the government’s financial department showcase that while the country is keeping up with the trend, it has no intention of including the blockchain phenomenon in legal domains"
"Exclusive: Ahead Of $400 Mn IPO, PayMate’s Board Nods Conversion Into ...

"After Deeptech, Reliance Bets On EV Ecosystem; To Invest INR 50 Cr In ... ",https://inc42.com/buzz/after-deeptech-reliance-industries-bets-on-ev-ecosystem-to-invest-inr-50-cr-in-altigreen/,"Reliance Industries’s energy arm Reliance New Energy Limited (RNEL) has bet on the EV ecosystem through Altigreen It has entered into an agreement to invest INR 5016 Cr in Altigreen Propulsion Labs (Altigreen), a regulatory filing accessed by Inc42 stated
RNEL will buy 34,000 compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS) in the Bengaluru-based startup The transaction is proposed to be completed before March 2022

“The investment is part of our company’s strategic intent of collaborating with innovative companies in new energy and new mobility ecosystems,” RIL said RIL, however, did not disclose the stake that it will acquire upon the conversion of the shares in Altigreen
Founded in 2013, Altigreen is an electric vehicle technology and solutions provider for commercial last-mile transportation through two, three and four-wheeled vehicles


It has built an in-house vehicle in Bangaluru and claims to have a presence in 60 countries with 26 global patents According to the regulatory filings, Altigreen had a turnover of INR 19353 Lakh in FY19, INR 6162 Lakh in FY20 and INR 10382 Lakh in FY21
Reliance Industries has maintained that acquisition is not a related-party transaction nor does it require any government or regulatory approval




While this is not the first time Reliance Industries has shown interest in the cleantech ecosystem, the direct acquisition marks the retail conglomerate’s plans to expand its presence in the segment
In October 2021, Reliance formed a joint venture with oil company BP to set up a Jio-BP branded mobility station in Navi Mumbai, ie to set up a network of electric vehicle charging and battery swap stations at its mobility stations and other standalone locations
Reliance BP Mobility joint venture has also tied up with Gurugram-based BluSmart to set up electric vehicle charging infrastructure Further, Reliance aims to create EV products and services in agreement with the Mahindra Group
Mukesh Ambani-Led Reliance Industries On A Shopping Spree
The news comes at a time when Reliance’s retail arm seems to be pulling all strings to its services online via the Jio platform Reliance Retail has also been actively investing in and acquiring startups catering to fast-growing segments Its most recent bet includes investing $15 Mn in Two Platforms Inc (TWO), a Silicon Valley-based deeptech startup for a 25% equity stake
Other bets:

Acquired retail lingerie business under the ‘Amante’ business from MAS Brands

ShareChat To Acquire Times Internet’s MX TakaTak For $700 Mn ,https://inc42.com/buzz/sharechat-to-acquire-times-internets-mx-takatak-for-700-mn/,"One of the most valued homegrown social media platforms ShareChat has finalised a deal to acquire Times Internet-owned MX TakaTak, a short video platform, for around $700 Mn deal
With this acquisition, ShareChat will now have two social short video platforms Moj and TakaTak under its arm 

The acquisition development was first reported by Reuters ShareChat declined to comment on the development at the time of publishing  
Money Control reported that 180 employees of TakaTak will join ShareChat’s 2,000 member team and that TakaTak will be rebranded within the next six months It took quite a while to reach for the deal to conclude Mint was the first to report on the development in 2021 


The development also comes two months after ShareChat’s parent Mohalla Tech raised $266 Mn in a fresh round of investment from Alkeon Capital with participation from new and existing investors such as Singapore’s Temasek, Moore Strategic Ventures, Harbourvest, and India Quotient 
With this investment round, ShareChat’s valuation soared by ~32% to $37 Bn within five months During its Series F round which was announced in July of 2021, it was valued at $28 Bn
Last year, ShareChat had raised three big investments within a gap of a few months The startup first raised its Series E round worth $502 Mn in April last year led by US-hedge fund Tiger Global along with Lightspeed Ventures, which helped it become the first indegenious social media platform to enter the unicorn club 




It is also to be noted that this $502 Mn investment came four months after the government of India outlawed popular TikTok citing security concerns TikTok was one of the biggest rivals of ShareChat’s Moj This was also during the same time when the central government was in a tussle with micro blogging platform Twitter 
Two months after becoming a unicorn ShareChat again raised $145 Mn in its Series F round led by Singapore’s Temasek, Moore Strategic Ventures, and Mirae- Naver Asia Growth Fund 
When combined, Mohalla Tech had raised around $913 Mn in 2021 itself, thus showing the investors’ confidence it enjoys Investors are also betting high on ShareChat, given its reach and India emerging as one of the most important social media markets for any social media platform in the country 
Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg who runs the busiest social media platform Facebook after witnessing the company’s first ever dip in user base said that Facebook’s slow user growth rate in India is due to data price hike India is the biggest market for Facebook 
ShareChat was founded in 2015 by Ankush Sachdeva, Bhanu Singh, and Farid Ahsan The social media platform positions itself as an Indic language social media platform The startup claims that it has an average user time spent of 31 minutes daily Moj and ShareChat together have a user base of 340 Mn"
"Govt Bans Drone Import To Promote Indian Industry; Exempts R&D, Defenc... ",https://inc42.com/buzz/govt-bans-drone-import-to-promote-indian-industry-exempts-rd-defence-purposes/,"In a bid to promote the homegrown drone industry, the Indian government has banned the import of drones with immediate effect, the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) said in a statement The ban exempts drone imports for research and development, defence and security purposes




The MoCA further clarified that while exceptions were provided for R&D, defence and security, importing drones for these purposes will require ‘due clearances’ However, the import of drone components will not require any approvals

The directorate general of foreign trade, of the ministry of commerce and industry, has notified the Indian Trade Classification (Harmonised System), 2022 on Wednesday about the prohibition of drones for import
The move comes shortly after the finance minister called on the entrepreneurs to create drone-based startups The FM Nirmala Sitharaman called for leveraging ‘Drone Shakti’ through a myriad of applications, adding that Drone-As-A-Service (DrAAS) startups were the need of the hour


In her Budget speech, Sitharaman also said that the use of ‘Kisan drones’ will be promoted for crop assessment, digitisation of land records, and spraying of insecticides and nutrients
She also highlighted the immense potential of Geospatial Systems and Drones, saying that the sector had the power to assist sustainable development, provide employment opportunities and modernize the country
The ban of drone import also follows the government approving a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme of INR 120 Cr for drones and drone components The decision comes at a time when the Indian drone startups aim to take wings and deliver essentials like drugs and vaccines in the farthest parts of the country
Through a PLI scheme, the government will provide incentives to companies for enhancing their domestic manufacturing It will help reduce dependence on imports and helps improve the cost competitiveness of local goods The PLI scheme will offer a 20% incentive over the value addition to manufacturers of drones and related software The scheme is available for three financial years starting 2021-22
The MoCA has predicted that the drones and drone components manufacturing industry may see an investment of over INR 5,000 Cr over the next 3 years The annual sales turnover of the drone manufacturing industry may grow from INR 60 Cr in FY 2020-21 to over INR 900 Cr in FY 2023-24



The drone manufacturing industry is expected to generate over 10,000 direct jobs over the next three years, it said
The Drone Market & Use Cases In India
In December 2021, telecom giant Reliance Jio announced that it had conducted successful trials of its connected drones on its indigenously developed 5G network
Further, many states have also begun long-range drone deliveries to test the viability of home deliveries of medicines, ecommerce and food orders using drones The pilot tests have begun in parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, and Punjab since June 2021
Hyperlocal delivery app Dunzo plans to test drone deliveries of medicines in Telangana through a partnership with the state government and the World Economic Forum In December 2021, logistics startup Delhivery had acquired California-based drone startup Transition Robotics for an undisclosed amount
The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has also been granted conditional exemption from the Drone Rules to use drones up to 3,000 metres [about 9,843 feet] in Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Manipur and Nagaland for conducting experimental — Beyond the Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) vaccine delivery — especially for remote areas
Indian drone startup ecosystem is a nascent stage – with just 180 drone startups and a mere $27 Mn being raised by these startups over the years



Indian startups such as SenseHawk, TechEagle, Ideaforge, among others have been offering drone solutions to increase better efficiency in various sectors
While the Drone Rules 2021 have allowed wider use of drones while balancing safety and security considerations in drone operations, industry initiatives and pilot tests have catapulted the growth of the homegrown drone ecosystem, having a total turnover of INR 80 Cr"
Govt Has No Record Of Shutdowns Ordered By State Govts: Centre ,https://inc42.com/buzz/govt-has-no-record-of-shutdowns-ordered-by-state-govts-centre/,"The Union Government has said that it does not maintain records pertaining to internet shutdowns ordered by state governments




This was stated in a written reply by Minister of State (MoS) for Communications, Devusinh Chauhan, in response to a query filed by BJP Member of Parliament, Varun Gandhi

Varun Gandhi also questioned the Centre about whether non-maintenance of such data impeded efforts to ascertain whether shutdowns were imposed in accordance with due rules and SC guidelines
In reply, Chauhan stated that, ”The review committee chaired by Chief Secretary of the respective state governments was mandated through Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 to ascertain that the shutdowns have been made in accordance with the said rules”


The SC guidelines that Gandhi was referring to were the directions issued by the Supreme Court in the Anuradha Bhasin Vs Union of India case The case sought to determine the constitutional validity of internet shutdowns imposed in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in August of 2019
In the judgement, the SC had ordered the Centre to ensure proactive publication of internet shutdown orders and periodic review by the Review Committee every seven working days
In addition to this, the SC had ruled that undefined restriction of internet services would be illegal and that right to the internet was protected under the constitution The Apex Court had also noted several gaps in the then Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017
Right after that in November of 2021, the Union Government amended the Rules and added Rule 2A which capped internet shutdown for a maximum period of 15 days
It is pertinent to note that until 2017, India did not have a codified law to order internet shutdowns All such requests were routed through Section 144 of the CrPC which vested the power to impose shutdowns with local district magistrates 
All that changed in 2017 when the new Telecom Suspension Rules were introduced under which internet shutdowns can now only be ordered by the home secretary of the union or state governments The rules necessitated shutdowns only where it was ‘necessary’ or in the ‘interest of public safety’
Since then, incessant internet shutdowns have earned India the moniker of ‘Internet shutdown capital of the world’



Back to the story, in response to another question raised by Gandhi about non-maintenance of suspension data, MoS said that the 2017 rules do not not mandate the Central Government to maintain any centralised data of internet suspensions 
This holds significance as India ranks third globally when it comes to shutting down the internet 
According to a report, Internet shutdowns, ordered by central, state and district level authorities in India, lasted a total of 1,157 hours in 2021 This led to a cumulative loss of $583 Mn and impacted over 59 Mn people across the country
India was only eclipsed by strife-torn Myanmar and Nigeria, where these blackouts lasted 12,238 and 5,040 hours respectively 
J&K has been at the receiving end of such internet blackouts The first reported internet shutdown in India took place in Jammu and Kashmir in 2012, when mobile internet services were suspended during protests against a movie that allegedly hurt Islamic sentiments
Since 2012, the Union Territory has seen over 320 instances of internet blackout, followed by Rajasthan with over 78 shutdowns Uttar Pradesh comes a distant third with 30 instances of internet suspension
This also comes after MP Shashi Tharoor-led Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, flagged frequent internet shutdowns Slamming the Centre, Tharoor called for defining the parameters and setting up of a robust mechanism for internet shutdowns



Barely a day ago, internet services were snapped indefinitely in Jharkhand’s Hazaribag and adjoining districts following violent communal clashes A week ago, the local administration in Arunachal Pradesh’s Itanagar had ordered suspension of all internet services over a protest by a local group In October last year, mobile internet services were snapped across Rajasthan during Rajasthan Administrative Services preliminary exams
Internet and telecommunication blackouts have been known to impinge on freedom of expression, affect local businesses and impede the studies of students While there are instances where the cases are genuine but in the absence of a robust mechanism, the situation could only worsen"
305 Notices Sent To Ecommerce Portals For Flouting Norms: Indian Govt ,https://inc42.com/buzz/305-notices-sent-to-ecommerce-portals-for-flouting-norms-indian-govt/,"A total of 305 cases have been registered against ecommerce companies for flouting various norms under the Legal Metrology Act, 2009




The violations pertaining to mandatory disclosures like country of origin and expiry dates The data relates to the intervening period between October 16, 2020 and February 3, 2022

This was stated by Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ashwini Kumar Choubey in a written reply to a question
The Minister also stated that so far 90 companies have been fined for the offences In addition to this, INR 4995 Lakh penalty has been imposed on the erring firms 


Giving a breakdown of the cases filed by State Governments, the Minister stated that 4,716 cases were registered in 2019, followed by 3,713 cases in 2020, and 2,996 cases were registered against ecommerce companies last year
Most of the violations were related to non-declaration of Country of Origin tags by the ecommerce websites As many as 281 cases were filed by State Governments under this category This was followed by 7 cases each filed for overcharging and non-disclosure of manufacturer’s address on the product label 
Back in September 2020, the industry department had asked ecommerce companies to complete assigning ‘country of origin’ tags to all existing products on their platforms The move was announced amidst rising tensions and a ballooning trade deficit with China
The notices were issued by the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) in a bid to “protect the rights of consumers as a class” 



The ecommerce firms were also booked for other violations, including violation of the Domestic Pressure Cooker (Quality Control) Order, 2020 Under this, 15 notices were issued to ecommerce portals for selling non-standardised pressure cookers online
The Minister also informed the Member of Parliament that such directions were generally published in the form of Quality Control Orders (QCOs) and additionally, the Bureau of Indian Standards  (BIS) has issued 3 notices for violation of QCO for Pressure Cookers and 2 for violation of the order relating to Helmets 
BIS mandates compulsory certification for certain items It ensures uniform conformity to standards to protect end-consumers from sub standard goods Under the QCO regime, only BIS certified items can be manufactured and sold in the Country
While the QCO for domestic pressure cookers came into force on February 1 last year, the QCO for helmets came into effect on June 1, 2021
This comes as the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) last month sent notices to ecommerce platforms on illegal facilitation and sale of wireless jammers In October last year too, the CCPA had announced that it had taken strong action on violations of consumer rights
In September of 2020, the National Green Tribunal had also pulled up ecommerce giants like Amazon and Flipkart over excessive use of plastic in their packaging



Such practises should not be allowed by the government and there is a need to ramp up enforcement of local rules In absence of these, such platforms can continue to sell substandard products, many of which can harm the end user"
"PhonePe Maintains Lead In UPI With 49% Market Share In Jan 2022, Whats... ",https://inc42.com/buzz/phonepe-maintains-lead-in-upi-with-49-market-share-in-jan-2022-whatsapp-at-0-02/,"UPI recorded 461 Cr transactions in January 2022 worth INR 831 Lakh Cr ($1113 Bn) While the number has been the ever-highest in the history of UPI, it only rose by 1% month-on-month




The app-wise performance has not changed either, and only recorded an average single-digit growth month-on-month PhonePe led the UPI numbers with INR 405 Lakh Cr transactions Google Pay maintained its second lead, with transaction value falling to worth INR 298 Lakh Cr

Next in line were Paytm (with transactions falling to INR 85,125 Cr); Amazon Pay (with transactions rising to INR 6,729 Cr) and WhatsApp Pay (with transactions worth INR 205 Cr)
In 2021, PhonePe led the industry on all key metrics including value and volume of transactions, registered users as well as merchant coverage The startup has been the market leader in UPI with over 46% market share in the volume of transactions processed last year


Interestingly, while PhonePe’s share in transaction counts remained the same for January 2022, transaction volume share rose to 487% Further, in 2021, the startup claimed to have crossed the 350 Mn registered user mark, clocking a 28% average month-on-month growth from January to December 2021

Google Pay’s market share, only second in line after PhonePe, fell from 375% to 344% While traditionally a fall in the market share is not a good sign for any company, but this may be good news for the US-based tech giant’s fintech arm 
NPCI’s guideline had asked the third-party app providers (TPAP) to cap their transaction value at 30% by December 2023 — ie PhonePe and Google Pay need to rescue their market share




The TPAP guidelines, aimed to prevent oligopoly and promote competition, is also one of the reasons why WhatsApp has only 002% UPI market share NPCI has disallowed WhatsApp from leveraging its payments platform to more than 500 Mn (50 Cr) users in the country 
For context, WhatsApp had 487 Mn registered users in 2021 in India alone, with 390 Mn active users, growing 16% year-on-year
To restrain WhatsApp from undermining the competition and creating a monopoly, its initial rollout was limited to 20 Mn users But in relief of the Meta-owned WhatsApp Pay, NPCI has recently allowed it to double the number of users on its payment platform in India to 40 Mn users
In January 2022, WhatsApp recorded 234 Lakh transactions worth INR 205 Cr — a 9% month-on-month growth (highest among the five players mentioned in the article)
UPI is currently the most popular digital payments system in India, with more than 282 banks linked to it The State Bank of India (SBI) was leading the segment by processing about 129 Cr UPI transactions, as of December 2021 
It was followed by HDFC Bank with 41 Cr transactions, Bank Of Baroda with 289 Cr, Union Bank with 281 Cr, ICICI Bank with 28 Cr and Paytm Payments Bank with 267 Cr transactions
[The numbers for January 2022 are yet to be disclosed by the NPCI]
The UPI Scenario In India
India’s digital economy has flourished over the past few years Inarguably, UPI’s success story has been a key instrument in the ‘Digital India’ initiative, with the homegrown payment gateway gaining success even overseas
Last year, the RBI also announced bringing UPI on feature phones The central bank observed that around 74 Cr mobile phone users have smartphones in the country out of the total 118 Cr mobile users The feature phone support for UPI could be more critical to UPI’s growth story as well as financial inclusion and digital penetration



Not only that, RBI has maintained that 50% of the transactions through UPI were below INR 200, thus, a framework to enable small value digital payments in offline mode has been issued Users will now be able to make small transactions (within INR 200) offline (without the use of internet or telecom connectivity) using channels or instruments such as cards, wallets and mobile devices in a UPI app 
It is aimed to conserve banks’ system resources, without any change in the transaction experience for the user — quite similar to a wallet system that Paytm, Amazon Pay and PhonePe offer
Recently, RBI’s Digital Payment Index (RBI-DPI) which aims to capture the penetration of digital payments in the country reported a 40% year-on-year growth by September 2021 The index’s data points include payment enablers, payment infrastructure — demand-supply aspects, alongside payment performance and consumer centricity
As per a report by ACI Worldwide, India retained the top spot in terms of digital transactions worldwide with 255 Bn real-time payments transactions, followed by China 
The growth was led by UPI, which recorded more than INR 73 Lakh Cr (approx $970 Bn) in CY21 — a year-on-year rise of over 110% as opposed to INR 3387 Lakh Cr transaction in CY20
And now, besides growing in India, UPI is set to debut overseas as well in countries such as the UAE, Bhutan, the USA, Japan, China, the UK, Singapore among others
Digital Banking & Financial Inclusion
During the Budget 2022 speech, Sitharaman said that 100% of post office banks will come under the core banking umbrella to boost financial inclusion The move is aimed at giving access to post office bank accounts through net banking, mobile banking, ATMs, and also provide online transfer of funds between post office accounts and bank accounts
“This will be helpful, especially for farmers and senior citizens in rural areas, enabling interoperability and financial inclusion,” she said in her Budget speech
To boost the adoption of digital banking services further, Sitharaman said that to mark 75 years of India’s independence, 75 digital banking units in districts will be set up by scheduled commercial banks



However, it is yet unclear what such a digital banking unit will entail Coupled with the digitalisation of post-office-run banking services, it is a clear sign that the government is looking to push digital banking in rural and semi-urban India
The government will also look to boost the overall fintech ecosystem by promoting the use of payments platforms that are economical and user-friendly
To further the digital payment ecosystem, under an incentive scheme for the promotion of RuPay debit cards and low-value BHIM UPI transactions, the govt will incentivise the banks by paying a percentage of the transaction value for FY22 For this, the govt has set aside a budget of INR 1,300 Cr"

"First Make In India, Then Seek a Rebate: India Tells Tesla ",https://inc42.com/buzz/first-make-in-india-then-seek-a-rebate-india-tells-tesla/,"The Union Government has categorically rejected Elon Musk’s request for a tax rebate on imported Tesla electric cars 




Making Centre’s stance amply clear, Union Minister for Heavy Industries, Krishan Pal Gurjar, recently told the Lok Sabha that there cannot be a situation where the market is India but jobs are created in China

Replying to a question, Gurjar said, “We can’t grant subsidies or relaxation in taxes to the said company as they don’t want to set up their manufacturing and other operation bases here Why should we favour a company which creates jobs in China and mints profit from our markets?”
Taking potshots at Tesla, Gurjar also reiterated the Centre’s stand on the issue saying that, “If you want to sell your product in our country, then manufacture them here itself”


Pointing out Tesla, he also added that, “The said company has not participated in any of our schemes, and that cleared their intentions that Tesla only wants to exploit our market to mint profit”
The Bone Of Contention
Musk has been at loggerheads with the union government over a range of issues from setting up a local factory to the country’s high import duty regime Tesla has been lobbying the government to slash import taxes on electric vehicles before it enters the market
In response, the Centre has time and again – overtly and covertly – told Tesla to first set up a manufacturing plant in India and then seek a tax rebate
The other issue appears to be high import duty India currently imposes 100% import duty on fully imported cars with a Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) value of more than $40,000 and 60% on cars whose CIF value is less than the amount
This is the latest in the saga of sabre-rattling between the government and Tesla Days ago, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs Chairman, Vivek Johri, was quoted as saying that, “We looked at whether the duties need to be re-jigged, but some domestic production is happening and some investments have come in with the current tariff structure So, it is clear that this is not a hindrance”
The Political Tug Of War
This was preceded by a political drama late last month when opposition ruled states rolled out a red carpet for Tesla boss asking him to manufacture the EV in their states
In  January this year, Elon Musk had tweeted that his company “was still working through with a lot of challenges from the Government (Centre)” In response, Ministers from Telangana to Punjab and from Bengal to Maharashtra invited him to invest in their respective states
The Tesla boss is known for his outbursts on Twitter and has even sought a meeting with PM Modi to lobby for slashing import duties



Why Is The Government Apprehensive?
Any such move is rife with fallout for the Union Government Granting any tax breaks to Tesla could discourage other auto manufacturers who are complying with the current tax regime Add to that, any such move could also adversely affect local manufacturers who lag behind Tesla in terms of financial might and technical expertise 
Add to that, any such rebate could just attract criticism from opposition quarters and could lead to a missed opportunity to create employment in the country
The recently announced Union Budget too had something in store for the sector The budgetary allocation for the subsidisation of the purchase of electric vehicles for FY23 was increased by 35x to INR 2,908 Cr
In addition to that, the Ministry of Heavy Industries has also formulated a scheme – Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India – to promote the adoption of EVs in the country Under the scheme, GST on all electric vehicles has been reduced from 12 percent to 5 percent, among other benefits
Days ago, the Delhi government unveiled draft guidelines for the regulation of the transportation activities of tech aggregators Electrification of the fleet has been given heavy importance in these new draft rules
The sector is also witnessing a slew of deals as companies ramp up their presence in the sector Recently, Tata Power and Apollo Tyres inked a pact to establish EV charging stations across the country
In addition to this, earlier last month, Mercedes-Benz announced that it will launch India’s first locally produced luxury electric car in 2022 itself
Meanwhile, India’s EV four-wheeler space is still in its nascent stages Local automakers like Mahindra, Tata and Maruti have facilities in India and can easily scale up Local players also have an added advantage of knowing the pulse of the people in a country where foreign automakers have more or less fallen flat 
While both local and foreign manufacturers have offered EVs, the adoption rate of such cars is poor EV penetration in India is extremely low at 08%, with four-wheelers forming a mere 4% of the total sales



But a major issue that could play spoilsport for Tesla is the price slab of its cars Tesla’s popular Model 3 which costs $39,990 – $54,990 (approximately INR 60 Lakh with import duties) could be way off-budget for price-conscious Indian households 
The Centre has cleared its stance on the matter and Tesla seems to be stumped All eyes are now on Elon Musk whether he will unveil the much touted EV in India or will he skip a huge market like India altogether"

Despite pandemic affecting premium payments, the global Insurtech market was valued at $94 Bn in 2020 and is projected to reach $158 Bn by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 327% from 2021 to 2030 
This comes amidst a resurgent Indian insurtech ecosystem Earlier today, Sachin Bansal-led Navi Technologies announced that it had converted itself into a public company, taking it one step closer towards a public listing 
Last month, Bengaluru-based fintech startup Finsall also raised INR 12 Cr in a Pre-Series A funding round led by Unicorn India Ventures (UIV) and SEA Fund,among others,

The Indian insurtech sector is dominated by big names such as Digit Insurance, Acko General, PolicyBazaar, OneAssist, PolicyBoss among others 
The insurtech segment shows no signs of slowing down and the investment in Nova Benefits is a testament to that But, while the market for the startup is niche, it has a huge market potential"
